Boulder:
I started out the week by creating the classes that would handle the URI mapping and responses (CategoriesResponse, RecipesResponse).
I also created entity classes for recipes and categories in order to map the scraped information to JSON objects and
then dish those up to the user when the URI is called.

I created tests for scraping by Categories and Category names and made sure they were passing.  After all tests passed,
I de-hard-coded both CategoriesResponse and RecipesResponse to incorporate Matt's RecipeScraper Class.

I finished up the week by creating the documentation for the Get By Categories use cases, and I also made a step by step guide
on how to map the JSON response to a MySql database in Workbench.

Boulder's Findings: This was my first time using a web scraper and building a web service, and I have to say that it was
a lot of fun and eye-opening as to how powerful (and slow) web scrapers can be.  The main difficulty I had was deciding
how I wanted to map the URIs and getting the JSON POJOs set up correctly took some trial and error, but I didn't hit any
major blockers during this project so I'm very pleased with how the project went.
