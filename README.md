# Team Bongo Java Project

## Problem Statement
Everyone has been in a situation where they've found an online recipe they like
only for the relevant information to be on a cluttered and unreadable site. Between having to hear
about stories from the author's childhood, ads, popups and everthing else, getting the recipe can be a 
straight up hassle. This project plans to use Jsoup in order to scrape and parse a popular
recipe site and provide only relevant data in the form of an api. 

This service will do the following:
- Get a single recipe in the form of JSON.
- Get all recipes in the form of JSON.
- Get a list of recipes based on food type.
- Get a list of recipes based on serving size.
- Get a list of recipes based on preptime.
